\section{Conclusion}

This work demonstrates that France can transition into
a fully \gls{SFR} fleet with installed capacity of 66,000 \gls{MWe} without
building additional \glspl{LWR}
if France receives \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
Supporting the \gls{SFR} fleet requires an average 
reprocessing capacity of 73.27 \gls{MTHM} per month,
and an average fabrication capacity of 45.29 \gls{MTHM} per month.


Since most \gls{EU} nations do not have an operating \gls{UNF}
repository or a management plan, they have a strong incentive
to send all their \gls{UNF} to France. The nations
with aggressive nuclear reduction will be able phase out nuclear
without constructing a permanent repository. France has an
incentive to take this fuel, since recycling used fuel from
other nations will allow France to meet their MOX demand
without new construction of \glspl{LWR}.

\Cref{tab:which_send} lists countries with the \gls{UNF} inventory
in 2040. We propose a strategy in which 
the Aggressive Shutdown nations send their \gls{UNF} to France.
The sum of \gls{UNF} from Spain, Italy, Belgium and Germany
provides enough \gls{UNF} for the simulated transition.
The four nations will then be able to decommission
their reactors without building a permanent repository.

Though complex political and economic factors are overlooked,
 and various assumptions present for this scenario,
this option may hold value for the \gls{EU} as a nuclear community,
and for France to advance into a closed fuel cycle.
