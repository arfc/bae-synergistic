\section{Conclusion}

This work demonstrates that France can transition into
a fully \gls{SFR} fleet with installed capacity of 66,000 \gls{MWe} without
building additional \glspl{LWR}
if France receives \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
Supporting the \gls{SFR} fleet requires an average 
reprocessing capacity of 73.27 \gls{MTHM} per month,
and an average fabrication capacity of 45.29 \gls{MTHM} per month.


Since most \gls{EU} nations do not have an operating \gls{UNF}
repository or a management plan, they have a strong incentive
to send their \gls{UNF} to France. The nations
with aggressive nuclear reduction will be able phase out nuclear
without constructing a permanent repository. France has an
incentive to take this fuel, since recycling used fuel from
other nations will allow France to meet their MOX demand
without new construction of \glspl{LWR}.

\Cref{tab:which_send} lists \gls{EU} nations and their \gls{UNF} inventory
in 2050. We propose a strategy in which 
the nations reducing their nuclear fleet send their \gls{UNF} to France.
The sum of \gls{UNF} from Italy, Slovenia, Belgium, Spain and Germany
provides enough \gls{UNF} for the simulated transition ($\approx 54,000$ MTHM). Sweden is not considered because of its concrete waste management plan.

Though complex political and economic factors are overlooked,
 and various assumptions present for this scenario,
this option may hold value for the \gls{EU} as a nuclear community,
and for France to advance into a closed fuel cycle.
