\section{Introduction}
We used \Cyclus to analyze
the future nuclear inventory in the European Union. \Cyclus is an agent-based extensible
framework for modeling the flow of material through future nuclear cycles.
We calculate the used fuel
inventory in \gls{EU} member states in 2050, and propose a potential collaborative strategy of used fuel
management.
A major focus of this paper is to determine the extent to which France has an incentive
to receive all the \gls{UNF} from \gls{EU} nations to create \gls{MOX}.
The \gls{MOX} created will fuel French transition to a \gls{SFR} fleet
and allow France to avoid building additional \glspl{LWR}.

Past research focuses solely on France, and typically assumes that additional \glspl{LWR},
namely \glspl{EPR} supply the \gls{UNF} required to produce \gls{MOX} \cite{carre_overview_2009, martin_symbiotic_2017, freynet_multiobjective_2016}.
Other recent works implement partitioning and transmutation
in a regional (European) context, with \glspl{ADS} and Gen-IV reactors \cite{fazio_study_2013}.
Little recent work considers synergistic international spent fuel arrangements.
The present work finds that this collaborative strategy can reduce the
need to construct additional \glspl{LWR} in France.
