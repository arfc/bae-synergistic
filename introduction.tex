\section{Introduction}
The stated long term plan for nuclear deployment in France targets a technology 
transition to \glspl{SFR}. However, the current inventory of French \gls{UNF} 
is insufficient to fuel that transition without building new \glspl{LWR}.

If instead, France accepted 
\gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations and used it to produce \gls{MOX} for new \glspl{SFR}.
The \gls{MOX} created will fuel French transition to a \gls{SFR} fleet
and allow France to avoid building additional \glspl{LWR}.


We used the \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator \cite{huff_fundamental_2016} to simulate
 \gls{EU} spent nuclear material inventory accumulation and to model the 
 proposed French 
 technology transition from \glspl{LWR} to
 \glspl{SFR}. \Cyclus is an agent-based extensible
framework for modeling the flow of material through future nuclear cycles.
We calculate the used fuel
inventory in \gls{EU} member states and propose a potential collaborative
strategy of used fuel management.


Past research focuses solely on France, and typically assumes that additional \glspl{LWR},
namely \glspl{EPR} supply the \gls{UNF} required to produce \gls{MOX} \cite{carre_overview_2009, martin_symbiotic_2017, freynet_multiobjective_2016}.
Other recent works implement partitioning and transmutation
in a European context, with \glspl{ADS} and Gen-IV reactors \cite{fazio_study_2013},
to reduce radiotoxicity for disposal.
Little recent work considers synergistic international spent fuel arrangements.
This work finds that a collaborative strategy can reduce the
need to construct additional \glspl{LWR} in France.
