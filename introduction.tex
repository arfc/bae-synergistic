\section{Abstract}
The French 2012-2015 Commission Nationale d'Evaluation Reports
\cite{cne2_reports_2015} emphasize preparation for a transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
We used \Cyclus \cite{huff_fundamental_2016} to explore the feasibility of enabling a French
transition to an \gls{SFR} fleet by using \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
A \Cyclus simulation ran from 1950 to 2050 for \gls{EU} nations to track the \gls{UNF} mass
and tails inventory. Another simulation ran to model the French
transition to \glspl{SFR} supported by reprocessing the \gls{UNF} inventory accumulated by the \gls{EU} nations.
These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment
of additional \glspl{LWR} by accepting \gls{UNF} from other EU nations.


\section{Introduction}
We used \Cyclus to analyze
the future nuclear inventory in the European Union. \Cyclus is an agent-based extensible
framework for modeling the flow of material through future nuclear cycles.
We calculate the used fuel
inventory in \gls{EU} member states in 2050, and propose a potential collaborative strategy of used fuel
management.
A major focus of this paper is to determine the extent to which France has an incentive
to receive all the \gls{UNF} from \gls{EU} nations to create \gls{MOX}.
The \gls{MOX} created will fuel French transition to a \gls{SFR} fleet
and allow France to avoid building additional \glspl{LWR}.

Past research focuses solely on France, and typically assumes that additional \glspl{LWR},
namely \glspl{EPR} supply the \gls{UNF} required to produce \gls{MOX} \cite{carre_overview_2009, martin_symbiotic_2017, freynet_multiobjective_2016}.
Other recent works implement partitioning and transmutation
in a regional (European) context, with \glspl{ADS} and Gen-IV reactors \cite{fazio_study_2013}.
Little recent work considers synergistic international spent fuel arrangements.
The present work finds that this collaborative strategy can reduce the
need to construct additional \glspl{LWR} in France.

\section{Methodology}
This work is based off of  two \Cyclus simulations. 
The first simulation calculated
the mass and composition of used fuel and tails accumulated by \gls{EU} nations from 1970 to 2050.
All EU nations with the exception of France adopt a once-through fuel cycle.
France can reprocess used \gls{UOX} and \gls{MOX} to
produce \gls{MOX} from reprocessed plutonium and depleted uranium (tails).
\Cref{diag:fc} shows the material flow.

After obtaining the \gls{UNF} inventory of all the \gls{EU} nations in 2050, the second
simulation runs. It it, the \gls{UNF} inventory is reprocessed and fabricated
as fuel for the newly deployed \gls{SFR} reactors.
\glspl{SFR} are modeled after the ASTRID breeder reactor \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}.
The ASTRID-type \glspl{SFR} make up for the decommissioned capacity
of \glspl{LWR} in France, to maintain a constant installed capacity of $66,000$ MWe up to 2160.
Eventually, the  \gls{MOX} created from recycled \gls{MOX}
fuels the entire fleet of 110 \glspl{SFR}.

All scripts and data used
in this paper are available in \cite{bae_arfc/transition-scenarios:_2017}.


\subsection{\Cyclus}
\Cyclus is an agent-based fuel cycle simulation framework, meaning that
each reactor, reprocessing plant, and fuel fabrication plant is modeled as an agent.
At each timestep (one month),
agents put out their bids for materials (supply and/or demand) and exchange
with one another. A market-like mechanism called the dynamic resource exchange
\cite{gidden_agent-based_2015} governs the exchanges.
Each material item has a quantity, composition, name, and a unique identifier
for output analysis. 
A \Cyclus input file contains prototypes, which are fuel cycle facilities with
pre-defined parameters, that are deployed in the simulation as \texttt{facility} agents.
Encapsulating the \texttt{facility} agents are the \texttt{Institution} and \texttt{Region}.
A \texttt{Region} agent holds a set of \texttt{Institution}s. 
An \texttt{Institution} agent can deploy or decommission \texttt{facility} agents.
The \texttt{Institution} agent is part of a \texttt{Region} agent,
which can contain multiple \texttt{Institution} agents.


For example, `France' would be a \texttt{Region} agent,
that may contain two \texttt{Institution} agents \glspl{LWR}
and \glspl{SFR}. The \texttt{Institution} agents would then deploy
\glspl{LWR} and \glspl{SFR} agents, respectively, according to a pre-defined deployment
scheme.


\subsection{\gls{EU} Historical Deployment Scheme}

The \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} database \cite{iaea_nuclear_2017} contains reactor
operation history.
The database is imported as a csv file, to populate the simulation
with deployment information, listing the country, reactor unit, type, net capacity (MWe), status,
operator, construction date, first criticality date, first grid date, commercial date, shutdown
date (if applicable), and unit capacity factor for 2013. Then only the \gls{EU} countries are extracted
from the csv file. We developed a python script to generate a \Cyclus input file from the csv file,
which lists the individual reactor units as agents.

         boxes represent codes that process the files.}

\end{figure}

Projections of future reactor deployment in this simulation are based on assessment of analyses
from references such as \gls{PRIS} for reactors planned for construction \cite{iaea_nuclear_2017},
the World Nuclear Association \cite{Worldd_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}, and works on the future of nuclear power in a global \cite{joskow_future_2012} and European context \cite{hatch_politics_2015}. 
The projections extend to 2050 at the latest. This allows the simulation to take place from
1970 to 2050. Later sections explain, in detail, the specific plans for each \gls{EU} nation.

Figure \ref{fig:eu_pow} displays the
timeseries of installed capacity in \gls{EU} nations.

\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Deployment Schedule}

Once \glspl{SFR} become available in 2040,
600-MWe \glspl{SFR} are deployed to make up for the 
decommissioned \gls{LWR} capacities. 
This results in an installed \gls{SFR} capacity of 66,000 MWe
 by 2076, when the last \gls{LWR} decommissions.

        \caption{This plot shows the potential French transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
				 The aggressive growth of nuclear in the 1980s leads to a substantial shutdown
				 of nuclear in the 2040s, which would be replaced by new \glspl{SFR}. The net
				 capacity is kept at a constant of 66 GWe.}

		     The second period of aggressive building occurs when the first generation
		     of \glspl{SFR} decommission after 80 years.}

\Cref{fig:sfr_num} and \cref{fig:dep} display
the French transition to \glspl{SFR} over time.
The steep transition from 2040 to 2060 reflects the scheduled
decommissioning of reactors built in the 1975-2000
era of aggressive nuclear growth in France.

In reality, building five reactors every year is highly unrealistic. However,
this analysis is to analyze material flow, claiming that, if such an aggressive
deployment scheme was to take place, the \glspl{SFR} would have enough fuel.
More realistically, the deployment of new \glspl{SFR} can be spread out by
staggering scheduled decommissioning of \glspl{LWR} through lifetime extensions.

\subsection{Material Definitions}
Depletion calculations of the nuclear fuel are recipe-based, such that a fresh 
and used fuel recipe is defined for each reactor type.
For the compositions of the fuel, a reference depletion calculation
from ORIGEN is used (see \cref{tab:comp}). The recipe has also been used for
\cite{wilson_adoption_2009}.


\subsection{Material Flow}
The simulated fuel cycle is illustrated in \cref{diag:fc}.
It it a source provides natural uranium. The uranium is enriched by an enrichment
facility to produce \gls{UOX}, while disposing enrichment waste (tails)
to the sink facility. The enriched \gls{UOX} fuels
the \gls{LWR}s and \gls{UOX} waste is produced. The used fuel
is sent to a pool to cool for 3 years \cite{carre_overview_2009}.
The cooled fuel is then reprocessed to separate plutonium and uranium,
or sent to a repository.
The plutonium mixed with depleted uranium (tails) makes \gls{MOX}.
Reprocessed uranium is unused and stockpiled. Uranium is reprocessed
in order to separate the raffinate (Minor actinides and fission products)
from `usable' material. Though neglected in this paper, reprocessed
uranium may substitute depleted uranium for \gls{MOX} production. In the
simulations, sufficient depleted uranium existed that using reprocessed
uranium was overlooked. However, further in the future where the depleted
uranium inventory drains, reprocessed uranium (or, natural uranium) will need to be utilized.
