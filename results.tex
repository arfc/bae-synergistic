timeseries of tails and used fuel inventory accumulation in \gls{EU}.
Figure \ref{fig:eu_fuel} shows the amount of fuel used in \gls{EU}.

\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Transition Scenario}

Reprocessing \gls{UNF} collected from all EU nations can start approximately
240 \glspl{SFR}, which is more than enough for two generations of 66GWe \gls{SFR}
fleet. With the \gls{SFR} breeding ratio of over one, France can transition into
a fully \gls{SFR} fleet without extra construction of \glspl{LWR}. 

From Varaine et al. \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}, a French
ASTRID-type \gls{SFR} of capacity 600 MWe needs $1.225$ tons of
plutonium a year, with an initial plutonium loading of $4.9$ tons. 
Thus, the number of \glspl{SFR} that can be loaded with the reprocessed
plutonium from \gls{UNF} can be estimated to $\frac{Pu \ from \ legacy \ \gls{UNF}}{4.9} \approx 240$ \glspl{SFR},
assuming infinite reprocessing and fabrication capacity as well as
abundant depleted uranium supply. 

Also, assuming that \gls{MOX} can be recycled indefinitely,
used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor contains enough plutonium to produce a \gls{MOX} fuel with
the same mass, if mixed with depleted uranium. For example,
used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor is assumed to be 12.6\% plutonium
in this simulation (see \cref{tab:comp}), whereas a fresh \gls{MOX} is 11\% plutonium.
Separating plutonium from used \gls{MOX} from
an ASTRID reactor can create \gls{MOX} of the mass of used \gls{MOX}.
The plutonium breeding ratio in this simulation is thus assumed to be
$\approx 1.145$.

\Cref{fig:fuel} shows \gls{MOX} loaded in the \glspl{SFR} per month.
The spikes are due to initial fuel demand for new deployment of \glspl{SFR}.
The initial loading of new \glspl{SFR} are done with the \gls{MOX} created
from legacy \gls{UNF}. Once the deployed \glspl{SFR} create enough amounts
 of extra plutonium, the legacy \gls{UNF} is no longer used.

	\end{center}
	\caption{This plot displays the timeseries of fuel loaded into \glspl{SFR}.
			 The initial purple bars denote that the fuel is from reprocessing
			 the previously used \gls{UOX} inventory. The peaks coincide
			 with the new deployment of \glspl{SFR}.}
	\label{fig:fuel}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:reprocess_waste} shows the amount of raffinate
(minor actinides, fission products) over time. The spikes in the 
waste discharge is due to large influx of used fuel from
decommissioned \glspl{SFR}. \Cref{fig:pu_no_cum} shows the separated plutonium discharge
per month from the reprocessing plant. The plutonium outflux
does not precisely follow the fuel demand because \Cyclus agents have
material buffers that store commodity fuel for later usage. 
\Cref{tab:sfr_sim_result} lists metrics obtained from the second simulation.
