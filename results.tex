\section{Results}

First, we confirmed that France does not have enough
\gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} to transition into a fully \gls{SFR}
fleet. As shown in figure \ref{fig:only_france}, France
cannot meet the \gls{ASTRID} fuel demand without receiving
\gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations. France
is able to fuel some of its \glspl{ASTRID} and breed more
plutonium, but cannot meet the fuel demand of 
all \glspl{ASTRID} with this aggressive deployment scheme.

			 \glspl{ASTRID}, thus a decrease in \gls{ASTRID} fuel supply.}

\subsection{Nuclear Material Inventory}

Table \ref{tab:sim_result1} 
lists \gls{EU} material inventory in 2050.
The materials continue to accumulate after 2050, but the
\gls{UNF} France receives before 2050 is most impactful for the
feasibility of the transition. Note that table \ref{tab:sim_result1} 
distinguishes the
\gls{UOX} in the simulation either stored or reprocessed to create \gls{MOX}.

Figures \ref{fig:eu_tail} and \ref{fig:eu_snf} show the 
accumulation of tails and used fuel over time in the \gls{EU}.
Tails accumulate as a by-product of uranium enrichment. 
Spent fuel is discharged from reactors every refueling period.
The entire core is discharged when the reactor decommissions.
A total of about $1,330,000$ MTHM of tails and $85,000$ MTHM of
\gls{UNF} have accumulated by 2050.
Figure \ref{fig:eu_fuel} shows the amount of fuel used in the \gls{EU}. The 
tails mass accumulation rate is fairly steady, with peaks occurring when new 
reactors are deployed.
In figure \ref{fig:eu_snf}, the peaks are caused by reactor decommissioning which 
triggers all the batches in the final reactor core to be sent to the repository.

\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Deployment}
\FloatBarrier

Reprocessing the \gls{UNF} collected from all EU nations can provide
approximately 913 tons of plutonium. Table \ref{tab:pu} lists the 
isotope, mass fraction, and quantity of plutonium that can be obtained from the 
2050 \gls{UNF} inventory.  With the \gls{SFR} breeding ratio above one, France 
can transition into a fully \gls{SFR} fleet without extra construction of 
\glspl{LWR}. 

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{Plutonium in the \gls{UNF} inventory.}
	\begin{tabular}{lrr}
		\hline
		\textbf{Isotope} & \textbf{Mass Fraction in Used Fuel [\%]} & \textbf{Quantity [t]} \\ \hline
		Pu238 & 0.0111 & 9.76 \\ 
		Pu239 & 0.518 & 506.05 \\ 
		Pu240 & 0.232 & 226.64 \\ 
		Pu241 & 0.126 & 123.09 \\ 
		Pu242 & 0.0487 & 47.57 \\ \hline
		\textbf{Total} & \textbf{0.9358} & \textbf{913.14} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	
	\label{tab:pu}
\end{table}

From Varaine et al. \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}, a French
ASTRID-type 600\gls{MWe} \gls{SFR} consumes $1.125$ metric tons of
plutonium a year, with an initial plutonium loading of $4.9$ metric tons.
 
Used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor is 23.95\% plutonium
in this simulation (see table \ref{tab:comp_fresh}), whereas fresh \gls{MOX} is 22\% plutonium.
The plutonium breeding ratio in this simulation is thus assumed to be
$\approx 1.08$.

Figure \ref{fig:fuel} shows \gls{MOX} loaded in the \glspl{SFR} per month.  The plot 
has peaks during a period of aggressive deployment of \glspl{SFR} followed by 
an equilibrium at 100 \gls{MTHM}. The peaks reoccur with the deployment of the 
second generation of \glspl{SFR}.  The spikes are due to initial fuel demand 
corresponding to these new deployments.  The initial cores loaded into new 
\glspl{SFR} rely on the \gls{MOX} created from legacy \gls{UNF}. Once the 
deployed \glspl{SFR} create enough extra plutonium, the legacy \gls{UNF} is no 
longer used. Notably, this switch from a less preferred fuel origin to a more 
preferred fuel origin is handled automatically within \Cyclus via user-defined preferences 
within its dynamic resource exchange algorithm \cite{gidden_methodology_2016}.


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{center}

	\end{center}
	\caption{Fuel loaded into \glspl{SFR} was simulated in discrete 
        batches.}
	\label{fig:fuel}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pu_no_cum} shows the separated plutonium discharge per 
month from the reprocessing plant. The plutonium outflux does not precisely 
follow the fuel demand because \Cyclus agents have material buffers that 
store commodity fuel for later usage. 
\gls{UNF} is stored for the initial loading of \glspl{SFR}.  Plutonium separated 
from legacy \gls{UNF} meets plutonium demands sufficiently to reduce the 
reprocessing demand for the first aggressive deployment of \glspl{SFR}.  
The plutonium from reprocessing legacy fuel is a flat rectangle because the 
reprocessing throughput was set to 183.2 $\frac{\gls{MTHM}}{month}$ to 
avoid reprocessing all the legacy in one timestep.

These results demonstrate that despite the large amount of initial plutonium that has to be reprocessed
prior to \gls{ASTRID} deployment, the 20 years (2020-2040) of 
\gls{ASTRID} fuel preparation
allows a reasonable level of average
\gls{UOX} reprocessing capacity demand. \gls{UOX} reprocessing continues 
until 2057, when the \gls{ASTRID} spent fuel can supply the plutonium
for its own fuel.
