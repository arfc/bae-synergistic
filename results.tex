\subsection{Nuclear Material Inventory}

\Cref{tab:sim_result1} 
lists \gls{EU} material inventory in 2050.
The materials continue to accumulate after 2050, but the
\gls{UNF} France receives before 2050 is most impactful for the
feasibility of the transition. Note that \cref{tab:sim_result1} 
distinguishes the
\gls{UOX} in the simulation either stored or reprocessed to create \gls{MOX}.

Figures \ref{fig:eu_tail} and \ref{fig:eu_snf} show the 
accumulation of tails and used fuel over time in the \gls{EU}.
Tails accumulate as a by-product of uranium enrichment. For every
ton of \gls{UOX} fuel, about nine times of tails is produced. 
Spent fuel is discharged from reactors every refueling period.
The entire core is discharged when the reactor decommissions.
A total of about $1,000,000$MTHM of tails and $100,000$MTHM of
\gls{UNF} have accumulated by 2050.
Figure \ref{fig:eu_fuel} shows the amount of fuel used in the \gls{EU}.

\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Deployment}

Reprocessing \gls{UNF} collected from all EU nations can start approximately
180 \glspl{SFR}. Table \ref{tab:pu} lists the isotope, mass fraction,
and quantity of plutonium that can be obtained from the 2050 \gls{UNF} inventory.
 With the \gls{SFR} breeding ratio above one, France can transition into
a fully \gls{SFR} fleet without extra construction of \glspl{LWR}. 

From Varaine et al. \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}, a French
ASTRID-type 600\gls{MWe} \gls{SFR} consumes $1.225$ metric tons of
plutonium a year, with an initial plutonium loading of $4.9$ metric tons. 
Thus, the number of \glspl{SFR} that can be loaded with the reprocessed
plutonium from \gls{UNF} can be estimated to be 200, assuming infinite 
reprocessing and fabrication capacity as well as abundant depleted uranium 
supply.
 
Used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor is 23.95\% plutonium
in this simulation (see \cref{tab:comp}), whereas a fresh \gls{MOX} is 22\% plutonium.
The plutonium breeding ratio in this simulation is thus assumed to be
$\approx 1.08$.

\Cref{fig:fuel} shows \gls{MOX} loaded in the \glspl{SFR} per month.
The spikes are due to initial fuel demand for new deployment of \glspl{SFR}.
The initial loading of new \glspl{SFR} are done with the \gls{MOX} created
from legacy \gls{UNF}. Once the deployed \glspl{SFR} create enough amounts
 of extra plutonium, the legacy \gls{UNF} is no longer used. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./images/french-transition/where_fuel.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{This plot shows the timeseries of fuel loaded into \glspl{SFR}.
			 The plot has peaks during a period of aggressive deployment of \glspl{SFR}
			 followed by an equilibrium at 100 \gls{MTHM}. The peaks reoccur with the
			 deployment of the second generation of \glspl{SFR}.}
	\label{fig:fuel}
\end{figure}


 \Cref{fig:pu_no_cum} shows the separated plutonium discharge
per month from the reprocessing plant. The plutonium outflux
does not precisely follow the fuel demand because \Cyclus agents have
material buffers that store commodity fuel for later usage. The reprocessed
plutonium from legacy \gls{UNF} is stored for the initial loading of \glspl{SFR}.
\Cref{tab:sfr_sim_result} lists metrics obtained from the second simulation.

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./images/french-transition/pu.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{This plot shows the separated plutonium discharge from the reprocessing plant.
			 The reprocessing demand for the first aggressive deployment of \glspl{SFR}
			 are lessened because the plutonium demand is met with plutonium separated from legacy \gls{UNF}.
			 The plutonium from reprocessing legacy fuel is a flat rectangle because the 
			 reprocessing throughput was set to 183.2 $\frac{\gls{MTHM}}{month}$ to avoid reprocessing
			 all the legacy in one timestep. }

Despite the large amount of initial plutonium that has to be reprocessed
prior to \gls{ASTRID} deployment, the 20 years of preparation of
\gls{ASTRID} fuel (2020-2040) allows a reasonable level of average
\gls{UOX} reprocessing capacity demand. \gls{UOX} reprocessing continues 
until 2057, when the \gls{ASTRID} spent fuel can supply the plutonium
for its own fuel.
