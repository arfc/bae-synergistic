\subsection{French SFR Deployment}

The Cycamore GrowthRegion archetype is able to dynamically increase, decrease,
or maintain installed nuclear capacity by deploying reactors according to net
electricity demand. In this simulation, the demand for installed nuclear
capacity in France was constant over time. After \glspl{SFR} became available
in 2040, the GrowthRegion therefore deployed \glspl{SFR} capacity to make up
for decommissioned \gls{LWR} capacity.  This resulted in an installed
\gls{SFR} capacity of 66,000 MWe by 2076, when the final \gls{LWR}
decommissioned. The specific deployment schedule is determined by the logic
within the Cycamore GrowthRegion archetype as shown in \cref{fig:sfr_num} and
\cref{fig:dep}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

        \caption{This plot shows the potential French transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
                 The aggressive growth of nuclear in the 1980s leads to a substantial shutdown
                 of nuclear in the 2040s, which would be replaced by new \glspl{SFR}. The net
                 capacity is kept at a constant of 66 GWe.}
        \label{fig:sfr_num}
        \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./images/french-transition/sfr_deploy.png}
    \caption{The deployment of \glspl{SFR} in France is characterized by a period of
             aggressive building. An average of four reactors are built per year to
             make up for the decommissioned power plants built in the 1980s and 1990s.
             The second period of aggressive building occurs when the first generation
             of \glspl{SFR} decommission after 80 years.}
    \label{fig:dep}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:sfr_num} and \cref{fig:dep} display
the French transition to \glspl{SFR} over time.
The steep transition from 2040 to 2060 reflects the scheduled
decommissioning of reactors built in the 1975-2000
era of aggressive nuclear growth in France.

In reality, building five reactors every year is highly unrealistic. However,
this analysis is to analyze material flow, claiming that, if such an aggressive
deployment scheme was to take place, the \glspl{SFR} would have enough fuel.
More realistically, the deployment of new \glspl{SFR} can be spread out by
staggering scheduled decommissioning of \glspl{LWR} through lifetime extensions.

\subsection{Transition Reprocessing Dynamics}

Reprocessing \gls{UNF} collected from all EU nations can start approximately
240 \glspl{SFR}, which is more than enough for two generations of 66GWe \gls{SFR}
fleet. With the \gls{SFR} breeding ratio of over one, France can transition into
a fully \gls{SFR} fleet without extra construction of \glspl{LWR}. 

From Varaine et al. \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}, a French
ASTRID-type \gls{SFR} of capacity 600 MWe needs $1.225$ tons of
plutonium a year, with an initial plutonium loading of $4.9$ tons. 
Thus, the number of \glspl{SFR} that can be loaded with the reprocessed
plutonium from \gls{UNF} can be estimated to $\frac{Pu \ from \ legacy \ \gls{UNF}}{4.9} \approx 240$ \glspl{SFR},
assuming infinite reprocessing and fabrication capacity as well as
abundant depleted uranium supply. 

Also, assuming that \gls{MOX} can be recycled indefinitely,
used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor contains enough plutonium to produce a \gls{MOX} fuel with
the same mass, if mixed with depleted uranium. For example,
used \gls{MOX} from an ASTRID reactor is assumed to be 12.6\% plutonium
in this simulation (see \cref{tab:comp}), whereas a fresh \gls{MOX} is 11\% plutonium.
Separating plutonium from used \gls{MOX} from
an ASTRID reactor can create \gls{MOX} of the mass of used \gls{MOX}.
The plutonium breeding ratio in this simulation is thus assumed to be
$\approx 1.145$.

\Cref{fig:fuel} shows \gls{MOX} loaded in the \glspl{SFR} per month.
The spikes are due to initial fuel demand for new deployment of \glspl{SFR}.
The initial loading of new \glspl{SFR} are done with the \gls{MOX} created
from legacy \gls{UNF}. Once the deployed \glspl{SFR} create enough amounts
 of extra plutonium, the legacy \gls{UNF} is no longer used. 

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./images/french-transition/where_fuel.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{This plot displays the timeseries of fuel loaded into \glspl{SFR}.
			 The initial purple bars denote that the fuel is from reprocessing
			 the previously used \gls{UOX} inventory. The peaks coincide
			 with the new deployment of \glspl{SFR}.}
	\label{fig:fuel}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:reprocess_waste} shows the amount of raffinate
(minor actinides, fission products) over time. The spikes in the 
waste discharge is due to large influx of used fuel from
decommissioned \glspl{SFR}. \Cref{fig:pu_no_cum} shows the separated plutonium discharge
per month from the reprocessing plant. The plutonium outflux
does not precisely follow the fuel demand because \Cyclus agents have
material buffers that store commodity fuel for later usage. 
\Cref{tab:sfr_sim_result} lists metrics obtained from the second simulation.
