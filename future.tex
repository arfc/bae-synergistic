\section{Future Nuclear Projections}

The future of nuclear energy in \gls{EU} nations is organized
in the table by the World Nuclear Association \cite{world_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}.
It is assumed that all the planned constructions are completed in their expected date without delay
or failure. Also, the newly constructed nuclear power plants are assumed to have a lifetime of 60 years.

\Cref{tab:eu_deployment} lists the reactors that are currently under construction or planned.

For each \gls{EU} nation, the growth trajectory is categorized from
"Aggressive Growth" to "Aggressive Shutdown". Aggressive growth is
characterized by a rigorous expansion of nuclear power while 
Aggressive Shutdown is characterized as a transition to rapidly
de-nuclearize the nation's electric grid. A nation's growth trajectory is
categorized into five spectra:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Aggressive Growth
	\item Modest Growth 
	\item Maintenance
	\item Modest Reduction
	\item Aggressive Reduction
\end{itemize}

The growth trajectory and specific plan of each nation in the \gls{EU} 
is listed in Table \ref{tab:eu_growth}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			Nation & Growth Trajectory & Specific Plan \\
			\hline
			France & Modest Reduction & Shutdown nuclear plants if they reach end of lifetime. No new construction.\\
			Germany & Aggressive Reduction & Close all nuclear reactors by 2022.\\
			Czech Republic & Modest Growth & Additional 2,400 MWe (AP1000s) by 2035.\\
			UK & Aggressive Growth & 13 units (17,900 MWe) by 2030.\\
			Belgium & Aggressive Reduction & All shutdown 2025.\\
			Sweden & Aggressive Reduction & All shutdown 2050.\\
			Finland & Modest Growth & Additional EPR in 2018, VVER in 2024.\\
			Bulgaria & Modest Growth & Additional AP1000 (1,000 MWe) construction in 2035. \\
			Poland & Aggressive Growth & Additional 6,000 MWe by 2035.\\
			Romania & Modest Growth & Additional 1,440 MWe by 2020. \\
			Hungary & Modest Growth & Additional 2,400 MWe (VVER-1200) by 2025. \\ 
			Spain & Maintenance & No plans to expand or early shutdown. \\
			Italy & Maintenance  & No plans to expand or early shutdown. \\
