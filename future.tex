\section{Future Nuclear Projections}

The future of nuclear energy in \gls{EU} nations is organized
in the table by the World Nuclear Association \cite{world_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}.
We assumed that all the planned constructions 
are completed without delay
or failure. Also, the newly constructed \glspl{LWR} are assumed to have a lifetime of 60 years.

\Cref{tab:eu_deployment} lists the reactors that are currently  planned or under construction.

For each \gls{EU} nation, the growth trajectory is categorized from
``Aggressive Growth'' to ``Aggressive Shutdown''. Aggressive growth is
characterized by a rigorous expansion of nuclear power while 
Aggressive Shutdown is characterized as a transition to rapidly
de-nuclearize the nation's electric grid. A nation's growth trajectory is
categorized into five degrees depending on G, the growth trajectory metric.
  
 \[
 G = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
 \text{Aggressive Growth}, & \text{for } G \geq 2\\
 \text{Modest Growth}, & \text{for } 1.2 \leq G < 2\\
 \text{Maintanence}, & \text{for } 0.8 \leq G < 1.2 \\
 \text{Modest Reduction}, & \text{for } 0.5 \leq G< 0.8\\
 \text{Aggressive Reduction}, & \text{for } G \leq 0.5
 \end{array}\right\} = \frac{C_{2040}}{C_{2017}}\\\\
 \]
 \[
  G = \text{Growth Trajectory  } [-] 
 \]
 \[
 C_{i} = \text{Nuclear Capacity in Year i  } [MWe]
 \]
 
The growth trajectory and specific plan of each nation in the \gls{EU} 
is listed in Table \ref{tab:eu_growth}.
