\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

An important aspect of any fuel cycle transition scenario
is the accrual of fissile materials for new reactor deployment.
The collaborative strategy makes a transition possible 
from the perspective of material availability,
but the aggressive transition demands a significant increase in reprocessing capacity.

We explored the impact of two key variables, the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} and the
breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors. The range over which we varied these parameters (\cref{tab:sen_par})
sought to capture the full span of their uncertainty.

              demand for the transition.}

\subsection{Breeding Ratio}

Increase in the breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors
decreases the monthly reprocessing demand, as shown in figure \ref{fig:br_rep}.
Increase in breeding ratio also reduces the number of total \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}
required for the transition, because the \gls{ASTRID} creates more plutonium.

    \caption{Increasing the breeding ratio decreases the monthly reprocessing demand. The
             demand up to 2050 is unaffected by breeding ratio because only \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}
             is reprocessed.}

\subsection{Lifetime Extension of French \glspl{LWR}}\label{sec:life}
Extending the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} dramatically lowers the average
monthly \gls{UOX} reprocessing demand, since the \gls{ASTRID} deployment becomes 
delayed (shown in figure \ref{fig:pow_diff}). The plutonium demand is delayed,
 allowing the reprocessing plant more time to prepare plutonium for \gls{ASTRID} reactors. 

Figure \ref{fig:ext_uox} shows the decrease in the average monthly
\gls{UOX} reprocessing burden with increased \gls{LWR} lifetimes,
which reduces to the current capacity of the La Hague site if all the
French \glspl{LWR} extended their operation for 20 years.
Figure \ref{fig:ext_all} shows that lifetime extension has little
effect on the average total monthly reprocessing demand, because
the amount of plutonium in the \gls{ASTRID} used fuel remains the same.
The initial increase is caused by the delay of \gls{ASTRID} deployment
delaying the first \gls{ASTRID} \gls{UNF} reprocessing. The period of which
\gls{ASTRID} \gls{UNF} is reprocessed decreases, which increases
the average.
