\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

The most important aspect of any fuel cycle transition scenario
is the accrual of fissile materials for new reactor deployment.
The collaborative strategy makes a transition possible materialistically,
but the aggressive transition demands an increase in reprocessing capacity.
This is due to both high initial plutonium loading of the \gls{ASTRID}
reactors and the low plutonium composition in spent \gls{UOX} fuel.

We varied two parameters, the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} and the
breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors. The parameters and their values
are listed in \cref{tab:sen_par}

        Breeding Ratio of \glspl{ASTRID} & 1.08 & 1.11, 1.15, 1.18 \\

              demand for the transition.}

\subsection{Breeding Ratio}

The result of the breeding ratio sensitivity analysis is shown in
\cref{fig:br_rep}.
Increase in the breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors
decreases the monthly average reprocessing, but the 
average \gls{UOX} reprocessing demand doesn't dramatically change,
because the time that \gls{ASTRID} fuel supplied from reprocessed
\gls{UOX} decrease with increase breeding ratio. The average monthly reprocessing
demands are calculated by dividing the total amount by the number of non-zero elements.

             but the average monthly \gls{UOX} reprocessing does not decrease due to shorter supply time. }

    \caption{Increasing the breeding ratio decreases the number of total \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}
             since the \gls{ASTRID} becomes self-sustaining earlier, no longer requiring
             plutonium from reprocessing \gls{UOX}.}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Lifetime Extension of French \glspl{LWR}}
Extending the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} dramatically lowers the average
monthly \gls{UOX} reprocessing demand, since the \gls{ASTRID} deployment becomes less
aggressive. the plutonium demand is delayed and allows the reprocessing plant more
time to produce the same amount of plutonium for \gls{ASTRID} reactors. The
extended deployment schemes are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:ext}.

The lifetime extension of French \glspl{LWR} have little impact on the total
monthly reprocessing capacity, since the amount of plutonium in the \gls{ASTRID} used fuel
remains the same.
