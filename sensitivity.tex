\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

An important aspect of any fuel cycle transition scenario
is the accrual of fissile materials for new reactor deployment.
The collaborative strategy makes a transition possible 
from the perspective of material availability,
but the aggressive transition demands a significant increase in reprocessing capacity.

We explored the impact of two key variables, the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} and the
breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors. The range over which we varied these parameters (\cref{tab:sen_par})
sought to capture the full span of their uncertainty.

Note that the breeding ratios of the \glspl{ASTRID} are arbitrarily increased
by editing the output fuel composition in the \glspl{ASTRID}. We did not 
take into account the other reactor parameters (e.g. core size, initial
fuel composition, fuel residence time, etc.)
that might change to achieve a higher breeding ratio. More detailed analyses
of the reactor physics and their effect on this transition scenario are future work.

\subsection{Breeding Ratio}


Increase in the breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors
decreases the monthly \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} reprocessing demand, as shown in 
figure \ref{fig:br_rep}. 
An increase in breeding ratio also reduces the number of total \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}
required for the transition, because the \gls{ASTRID} creates more plutonium.
The demand previous to 2050 is unaffected by the 
breeding ratio because only \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF} is reprocessed.

    \caption{Increasing the breeding ratio decreases the monthly reprocessing 
    demand.}
    \label{fig:br_rep}
\end{figure}


The sensitivity analysis also shows, as demonstrated in \cref{fig:br_uox} that 
increasing the breeding ratio decreases the mass of \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF} 
required for the transition. The \glspl{ASTRID} produce more plutonium, reducing the plutonium demand from reprocessed \gls{UOX}.

    \caption{Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that increasing the breeding 
    ratio decreases the required \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}. }

\subsection{Lifetime Extension of French \glspl{LWR}}\label{sec:life}
Extending the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} dramatically lowers the average
monthly \gls{UOX} reprocessing demand, since the \gls{ASTRID} deployment becomes 
delayed (shown in figure \ref{fig:pow_diff}). The plutonium demand is delayed,
 allowing the reprocessing plant more time to prepare plutonium for \gls{ASTRID} reactors.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

        \includegraphics[height=0.25\textheight]{./images/sensitivity/pow_ratio.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The ratio of \glspl{ASTRID} to \glspl{LWR} in France demarcates 
    the transition period.}
    \label{fig:pow_diff}
\end{figure}

 Increasing \gls{LWR} lifetimes also enables a less aggressive transition to 
 \glspl{ASTRID}. 
Figure \ref{fig:ext_uox} shows the decrease in the average monthly
\gls{UOX} reprocessing burden with increased \gls{LWR} lifetimes,
which reduces to the current capacity of the La Hague site if all the
French \glspl{LWR} extended their operation for 20 years.
However, figure \ref{fig:ext_all} shows that lifetime extension has little
effect on the average total monthly reprocessing demand, because
the amount of plutonium in the \gls{ASTRID} used fuel remains the same.
The initial increase is caused by the delay of \gls{ASTRID} deployment
delaying the first \gls{ASTRID} \gls{UNF} reprocessing. The period during which
\gls{ASTRID} \gls{UNF} is reprocessed decreases, which increases
the average.
