\section{Sensitivity Analysis}

An important aspect of any fuel cycle transition scenario
is the accrual of fissile materials for new reactor deployment.
The collaborative strategy makes a transition possible 
from the perspective of material availability,
but the aggressive transition demands a significant increase in reprocessing capacity.

We explored the impact of two key variables, the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} and the
breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors. The range over which we varied these parameters (table \ref{tab:sen_par})
sought to capture the full span of their uncertainty.

Note that \gls{ASTRID} breeding ratios are arbitrarily increased
by direct adjustment of their output fuel compositions. We did not 
take into account the other reactor parameters (e.g. core size, initial
fuel composition, fuel residence time, etc.)
that would be neccessary to achieve a higher breeding ratio. More detailed analyses
of the reactor physics and their effect on this transition scenario 
should be pursued in future work.

\end{table}

\subsection{Breeding Ratio}


Increase in the breeding ratio of \gls{ASTRID} reactors
decreases the total reprocessing demand, as shown in 
figure \ref{fig:br_rep}.
The demand previous to 2050 is unaffected by the 
breeding ratio because only \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF} is reprocessed.

    \end{center}
    \caption{Increasing the breeding ratio decreases the monthly reprocessing 
    demand.}
    \label{fig:br_rep}
\end{figure}

The sensitivity analysis also shows, as demonstrated in figure \ref{fig:br_uox} that 
increasing the breeding ratio decreases the mass of \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF} 
required for the transition. The \glspl{ASTRID} produce 
more plutonium, reducing the plutonium demand from 
reprocessed \gls{UOX}. However, since \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} is not
the limiting factor for this transition scenario,
increasing the breeding ratio does not play a significant
role in the transition scenario, especially considering the technical difficulty
in achieving a high breeding ratio.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

        \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{./images/sensitivity/br_uox_unf_cum.png}

    \caption{Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that increasing the breeding 
    ratio decreases the required \gls{UOX} \gls{UNF}. }
    \label{fig:br_uox}
\end{figure}

The differential impacts of varying the breeding ratios are
shown in table \ref{tab:br_diff}. The difference were calculated
using the following equation:

\[ \epsilon = \frac{(x - x_{base})}{x_base} * 100 \]

	\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
		\hline
                & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\% Difference} \\
		\textbf{Breeding Ratio $\longrightarrow$}& \textbf{1.08}& \textbf{1.11} & \textbf{1.15} & \textbf{1.18} \\
		\hline
		Total reprocessing demand & 0.0 & -1.8 & -2.6 & -3.4 \\ 
		\gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} reprocessed & 0.0  & -4.9 & -8.0 & -9.7 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:br_diff}
\end{table}


\subsection{Lifetime Extension of French \glspl{LWR}}\label{sec:life}
Extending the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} lowers the average
monthly \gls{UOX} reprocessing demand, since the \gls{ASTRID} deployment becomes 
delayed (shown in figure \ref{fig:pow_diff}). The plutonium demand is delayed,
 allowing the reprocessing plant more time to prepare plutonium for \gls{ASTRID} reactors.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./images/sensitivity/pow_ratio.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The ratio of \glspl{ASTRID} to \glspl{LWR} in France demarcates 
    the transition period.}
    \label{fig:pow_diff}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ext_uox} shows the decrease in the average monthly
\gls{UOX} reprocessing burden with increased \gls{LWR} lifetimes.
This is balanced by extending the necessary duration of 
\gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} reprocessing,
so
the total amount of \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} reprocessed increases nonetheless.


The differential impacts of varying the French \gls{LWR} lifetimes are
shown in table \ref{tab:ext_diff}. The difference were calculated
using the same equation used for the breeding ratio sensitivity study.


\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./images/sensitivity/ext_uox_rep.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Increasing the lifetime of French \glspl{LWR} decreases the monthly
		\gls{UOX} reprocessing demand, but increases the duration of \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF}
		reprocessing, thereby increasing the total amount of \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} reprocessed.}
	\label{fig:ext_uox}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ext_all} shows that lifetime extension has little
effect on the \emph{average} monthly reprocessing demand, because
the amount of plutonium in the \gls{ASTRID} used fuel remains the same.
The delay of \gls{ASTRID} deployment simply provides more time for
France to prepare the fuel. 
Extended \gls{LWR} lifetimes delay transition, and provide France with
time to accumulate \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF}. However, these 
license extensions do not reduce
the total reprocessing capacity required for transition.
