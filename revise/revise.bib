	abstract = {Within the framework of the ASTRID project, core design studies are being conducted by the CEA with support from AREVA and EDF. The pre-conceptual design studies are being conducted in accordance with the GEN IV reactor objectives, particularly in terms of improving safety. This involves limiting the consequences of 1) a hypothetical control rod withdrawal accident (by minimizing the core reactivity loss during the irradiation cycle), and 2) an hypothetical loss-of-flow accident (by reducing the sodium void worth). Two types of cores are being studied for the ASTRID project. The first is based on a {\textquoteleft}large pin/small spacing wire{\textquoteright} concept derived from the SFR V2b, while the other is based on an innovative CFV design. A distinctive feature of the CFV core is its negative sodium void worth. In 2011, the evaluation of a preliminary version (v1) of this CFV core for ASTRID underlined its potential capacity to improve the prevention of severe accidents. An improved version of the ASTRID CFV core (v2) was proposed in 2012 to comply with all the control rod withdrawal criteria, while increasing safety margins for all unprotected-loss-of-flow (ULOF) transients and improving the general design. This paper describes the CFV v2 design options and reports on the progress of the studies at the end of pre-conceptual design phase 1 concerning: {\textendash}Core performance,{\textendash}Intrinsic behavior during unprotected transients,{\textendash}Simulation of severe accident scenarios,{\textendash}Qualification requirements. The paper also specifies the open options for the materials, sub-assemblies, absorbers, and core monitoring that will continue to be studied during the conceptual design phase.},

	abstract = {In France, the ASTRID prototype is a sodium-cooled fast neutron industrial demonstrator, fulfilling the criteria for Generation IV reactors. ASTRID will meet safety requirements as stringent as for 3rd generation reactors, and take into account lessons from the Fukushima accident. The objectives are to reinforce the robustness of the safety demonstration for all safety functions. ASTRID will feature an innovative core with a negative sodium void coefficient, take advantage of the large thermal inertia of SFRs for decay heat removal, and provide for a design either eliminating the sodium{\textendash}water reaction, or guaranteeing no consequences for safety in case such reaction would take place.
R{\'e}sum{\'e}
En France, le prototype ASTRID est un d{\'e}monstrateur industriel {\`a} neutrons rapides, refroidi au sodium, r{\'e}pondant aux crit{\`e}res des r{\'e}acteurs de 4{\`e}me g{\'e}n{\'e}ration. ASTRID sera soumis {\`a} des crit{\`e}res de s{\^u}ret{\'e} aussi s{\'e}v{\`e}res que pour les r{\'e}acteurs de 3{\`e}me g{\'e}n{\'e}ration, et prendra en compte les enseignements de l'accident de Fukushima. L'objectif est de renforcer la robustesse de la d{\'e}monstration de s{\^u}ret{\'e} pour l'ensemble des fonctions de s{\^u}ret{\'e}. ASTRID aura un c{\oe}ur innovant {\`a} coefficient de vidange sodium n{\'e}gatif, b{\'e}n{\'e}ficiera de la grande inertie thermique des RNR-Na pour l'{\'e}vacuation de la puissance r{\'e}siduelle, et soit {\'e}liminera par conception la r{\'e}action sodium{\textendash}eau, soit garantira l'absence de cons{\'e}quences sur la s{\^u}ret{\'e} le cas {\'e}ch{\'e}ant.},
