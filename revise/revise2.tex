\section*{Review General Response}
We would like to thank the reviewers for their detailed assessment of
this paper. Your comments have resulted in changes which certainly improved the 
paper. We have re-run the many simulations in this paper according to the 
suggestions in this work and the results have been updated.


\section*{Reviewer 1}
\begin{questions}
    \question In Table 4 the BWR initial enrichment is now given as 5.8 w/o which seems high to me. Not only does this not match the mean discharge burnup, but it exceeds the 5.0 w/o criticality limit in current fuel fabrication plants. 

    \begin{solution}
    Thank you for your insight. The $5.8 ^{235}U$ value in table 4
    is the initial fissile loading in tonnes. Given the core size
    ($~137$ tonnes), the enrichment is therefore $4.2\%$.
    \end{solution}


    \question I don't understand Figure 9 - there is a blue line captioned "from reprocessed LWR UNF", but the line is hardly showing in the graph. Is this intended?

    \begin{solution}
    The blue line is supposed to be a very thin plane. We intentionally
    plotted this to show that the ASTRID fuel that can be created
    from outstanding French \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF} is very small.
    \end{solution}

    \question Very trivial: Table 12 footnote should read "... are not considered for ..."

    \begin{solution}
        Thank you. We made sure the table 12 footnote says `` are not considered for ''
    \end{solution}


\end{questions}
\section*{Reviewer 2}
\begin{questions}
    \question First, the authors refer to the ASTRID reactors as becoming "independent"; I think a more clear term here would be "self-sustaining" in that this fleet is exclusively relying upon plutonium bred from this fleet to sustain core reloadings. (Note that I understand the authors' intent; effectively the ASTRID fleet decouples from the LWR fleet, but it may simply make this point more clearly.)

    \begin{solution}
    That is a very good point, thank you. We have made the changes
    accordingly.
    \end{solution}

    \question Second, in Table 11, I assume the authors mean "Average LWR UNF reprocessed (PER MONTH)" and "(Total) Average UNF reprocessed (PER MONTH)". (Alternatively, these might be expressed as, "Average monthly LWR UNF reprocessing demand" and "Average monthly total UNF reprocessing demand"). I point this out because this can become a bit confusing; the first two entries on this table correspond to absolute values of mass (MT UNF / ASTRID fuel), whereas the second two correspond to RATES (fuel processing demand). The authors make this clear in the text, but I had to go through and re-read after looking at the table to grasp this subtle difference.

    \begin{solution}
    That is a very good point. We made the following changes
    in table 11 for clarity:
    
    Average LWR UNF reprocessed $\rightarrow$ Avg. LWR UNF reprocessed [per month]

    Average UNF reprocessed $\rightarrow$ Avg. UNF reprocessed [per month]

    \end{solution}

    \question Additionally, while a comparison of the average reprocessing
    demand resulting from LWR life extensions is useful, one other
     feature I observed is in the peak reprocessing demand (which roughly appears to correlate 
     with the LWR phase-out period and second phase of ASTRID construction). Essentially,
    it would appear that the peak monthly reprocessing demand is just over 40 MTHM/month,
    whereas the average demand is well under 30 MTHM. Effectively then, the reprocessing 
    capacity specified in Table 3 doesn't seem to be limiting (unless I am mistaken). The
    authors appear to assume a doubling of reprocessing capacity post-ASTRID, but this 
    assumption doesn't seem to be required or justified by the physics; if anything,
    maintaining (or even drawing down) capacity would seem to be in order. I don't think
    the authors should go back and repeat the study for this, but it is certainly a
    policy-relevant outcome worth noting.

    \begin{solution}
        If you are looking at Figure 14 for the reprocessing demand, the figure
        represents the amount of plutonium discharged from the reprocessing plants,
        which is proportional to the amount of \gls{UNF} reprocessed. To get the
        reprocessing demand, one should multiply the `pu from legacy' value by
        approximately 100 (since plutonium is \textasciitilde 1\% of \gls{LWR} \gls{UNF})
        and the `pu from spent sfr fuel' by 4.17 (plutonium is \textasciitilde 24\% of
        ASTRID \gls{UNF}). So the average reprocessing demand would be closer to
        125.1 MTHM /month, with a peak reprocessing demand being around 166.8 MTHM / month.

        Another thing to note is that the plutonium outflux from the reprocessing facilities
        does not directly reflect the plutonium demand for ASTRID fuels. The best way to 
        predict reprocessing demand is to look at actual ASTRID fuel demand and `back calculate'
        the \gls{UNF} reprocessing demand. We understand that this is not clear in the paper,
        so we added a plot showing the average reprocessing demand.

        \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{../images/french-transition/avg_tot_rep.png}

    \end{solution}

    \question Finally, while I know it's nitpicky, you may want to reference the equation on Page 25 by a LaTeX label, rather than relative physical position.

    \begin{solution}
    You are absolutely right. We have made changes accordingly.
    Thank you.
    \end{solution}

    \question Otherwise, I greatly appreciate the effort the authors have put in to clarify working assumptions used in this work,
    particularly as they pertain to both assumptions used to calculate the depleted fuel recipe as well as assumptions (and the limitations thereof)
    for the fuel vector supplied to the ASTRID fleet. Some of these assumptions, such as the breeding ratio,
    while ignoring practical operational considerations are nonetheless instructive as an high-level sensitivity analysis.
    The additions that the authors have made to caveat and bound these assumptions is quite helpful.

    \begin{solution}
    Thank you for your kindness. We believe that you and the other reviewers' comments greatly enriched
    this paper as a whole. Thank you.
    \end{solution}
