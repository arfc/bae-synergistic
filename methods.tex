\section{Methodology}
The \gls{EU} nations' nuclear reactor operating
history is modeled to the furthest foreseeable future.
The \gls{UNF} from \gls{EU} nations is stored for later usage.
France, on top of its historical operation with \gls{MOX} production
for its \glspl{PWR}, transitions into a 66GWe \gls{SFR} fleet
starting from 2040. France begins Production of fuel for \glspl{SFR}
in 2020 by recycling the stored \gls{UNF}.
The \glspl{SFR} are modeled after the \gls{ASTRID} breeder reactor \cite{varaine_pre-conceptual_2012}.


All scripts and data used
in this paper are available in \cite{bae_arfc/transition-scenarios:_2017}.


\subsection{\Cyclus}

\Cyclus is an agent-based fuel cycle simulation framework \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}, meaning that
each reactor, reprocessing plant, and fuel fabrication plant is modeled as an agent.
At each timestep (one month),
agents put out their bids for materials (supply and/or demand) and exchange
with one another. A market-like mechanism called the dynamic resource exchange
\cite{gidden_agent-based_2015} governs the exchanges.
Each material item has a quantity, composition, name, and a unique identifier
for output analysis. 
A \Cyclus input file contains prototypes, which are fuel cycle facilities with
pre-defined parameters, that are deployed in the simulation as \texttt{facility} agents.
Encapsulating the \texttt{facility} agents are the \texttt{Institution} and \texttt{Region}.
A \texttt{Region} agent holds a set of \texttt{Institution}s. 
An \texttt{Institution} agent can deploy or decommission \texttt{facility} agents.
The \texttt{Institution} agent is part of a \texttt{Region} agent,
which can contain multiple \texttt{Institution} agents. Several versions of \texttt{Institution}
and \texttt{Region} exist, varying in complexity and functions \cite{huff_extensions_2014}.
 \texttt{DeployInst} is used as the institution archetype for this work, where the institution
deploys agents in a user-defined time. 


For example, `France' would be a \texttt{Region} agent,
that may contain two \texttt{Institution} agents \glspl{LWR}
and \glspl{SFR}. The \texttt{Institution} agents would then deploy
\glspl{LWR} and \glspl{SFR} agents, respectively, according to a pre-defined deployment
scheme. 


\subsection{Nuclear Deployment in the \gls{EU}}


The \gls{IAEA} \gls{PRIS} database \cite{iaea_pris_2017} contains reactor
operation history.
The database is imported as a csv file, to populate the simulation
with deployment information, listing the country, reactor unit, type, net capacity (\gls{MWe}), status,
operator, construction date, first criticality date, first grid date, commercial date, shutdown
date (if applicable), and unit capacity factor for 2013. Then only the \gls{EU} countries are extracted
from the csv file. We developed a python script to generate a \Cyclus input file from the csv file,
which lists the individual reactor units as agents.

         boxes represent codes that process the files.}

\end{figure}


Projections of future reactor deployment in this simulation are based on
assessment of analyses from references such as \gls{PRIS} for reactors planned
for construction \cite{iaea_pris_2017}, the World Nuclear Association
\cite{world_nuclear_association_nuclear_2017}, and works on the future of
nuclear power in a global \cite{joskow_future_2012} and European context
\cite{hatch_politics_2015}.  The projections extend to 2050 at the latest. This
allows the simulation to take place from 1970 to 2050. Later sections explain,
in detail, the specific plans for each \gls{EU} nation.

\Cref{tab:eu_deployment} lists the reactors that are currently  planned or
under construction.  All  planned constructions are completed without delay or
failure and are assumed to reach a lifetime of 60 years.

For each \gls{EU} nation, the growth trajectory is categorized from
``Aggressive Growth'' to ``Aggressive Shutdown''. Aggressive growth is
characterized by a rigorous expansion of nuclear power while
Aggressive Shutdown is characterized as a transition to rapidly
de-nuclearize the nation's electric grid. A nation's growth trajectory is
categorized into five degrees depending on G, the growth trajectory metric.

 \[
 G = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
 \text{Aggressive Growth}, & \text{for } G \geq 2\\
 \text{Modest Growth}, & \text{for } 1.2 \leq G < 2\\
 \text{Maintanence}, & \text{for } 0.8 \leq G < 1.2 \\
 \text{Modest Reduction}, & \text{for } 0.5 \leq G< 0.8\\
 \text{Aggressive Reduction}, & \text{for } G \leq 0.5
 \end{array}\right\} = \frac{C_{2040}}{C_{2017}}\\\\
 \]
 \[
  G = \text{Growth Trajectory  } [-] 
 \]
 \[
 C_{i} = \text{Nuclear Capacity in Year i  } [\gls{MWe}]

The growth trajectory and specific plan of each nation in the \gls{EU} 
is listed in Table \ref{tab:eu_growth}.

\subsection{French \gls{SFR} Deployment Schedule}

From 2040,
600-\gls{MWe} \glspl{SFR} are deployed to make up for the 
decommissioned \gls{LWR} capacities. 
This results in an installed \gls{SFR} capacity of 66,000 \gls{MWe}
 by 2076, when the last \gls{LWR} decommissions.

                 The aggressive growth of nuclear in the 1980s leads to a substantial shutdown

                 capacity is kept at a constant of 66 GWe.}

\Cref{fig:sfr_num} and \ref{fig:dep} display
the French transition to \glspl{SFR} over time.
\Cref{fig:tot_dep} displays the total deployment
scheme of the simulation.
The steep transition from 2040 to 2060 reflects the scheduled
decommissioning of reactors built in the 1975-2000
era of aggressive nuclear growth in France.

In reality, building five reactors every year is highly unrealistic. However,
this analysis is to analyze material flow, claiming that, if such an aggressive
deployment scheme was to take place, the \glspl{SFR} would have enough fuel.
More realistically, the deployment of new \glspl{SFR} can be spread out by
staggering scheduled decommissioning of \glspl{LWR} through lifetime extensions.
An analysis of the effect of \gls{LWR} lifetime extension is shown in a later section.



\subsection{Material Flow}
The simulated fuel cycle is illustrated in \cref{diag:fc}.

A source provides natural uranium, which is enriched by an enrichment
facility to produce \gls{UOX}, while disposing enrichment waste (tails)
to the sink. The enriched \gls{UOX} fuels
the \gls{LWR}s and \gls{UOX} waste is produced. The used fuel
is sent to a pool to cool for at least 3 years \cite{carre_overview_2009}.

The cooled fuel is then reprocessed to separate plutonium and uranium,
or sent to a repository.
The plutonium mixed with depleted uranium (tails) makes \gls{MOX}.
Reprocessed uranium is unused and stockpiled. Uranium is reprocessed
in order to separate the raffinate (minor actinides and fission products)
from `usable' material. Though neglected in this paper, reprocessed
uranium may substitute depleted uranium for \gls{MOX} production. In the
simulations, sufficient depleted uranium existed that using reprocessed
uranium was overlooked. However, further in the future where the depleted
uranium inventory drains, reprocessed uranium (or, natural uranium) will need to be utilized.

\section{Reactor Specifications}
Three major reactors are used in the simulation, \gls{PWR}, \gls{BWR}, and ASTRID-type \gls{SFR} reactors.


For \glspl{LWR}, we used a linear core size model to capture
varying reactor capacity. For example, a 
1,200 \gls{MWe} PWR has $193*\frac{1,200}{1,000} = 232$ \gls{UOX} assemblies, each
weighing 523.4 kg.
After each 18 month cycle, one-third of the 
core (77 assemblies) discharges. Refueling
is assumed to take 2 months to complete, during which the reactor
is shut down. This value is acquired by averaging the 
historical refueling outage. The specifications are defined in 
\Cref{tab:reactor-specs} details the reactor specifications in this simulation.

\subsection{Material Definitions}
Depletion calculations of the nuclear fuel are recipe-based, such that a fresh 
and used fuel recipe is defined for each reactor type.
For the compositions of the used fuel, a reference depletion calculation
from ORIGEN is used (see \cref{tab:comp}). The recipe has also been used for
\cite{wilson_adoption_2009}.
