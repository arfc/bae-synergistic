\section{Abstract}
The French 2012-2015 Commission Nationale d'Evaluation Reports
\cite{cne2_reports_2015} emphasize preparation for a transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
We used \Cyclus \cite{huff_fundamental_2016} to explore the feasibility of enabling a French
transition to an \gls{SFR} fleet by using \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
A \Cyclus simulation ran from 1950 to 2160 for \gls{EU} nations to estimate the \gls{UNF} mass
and tails inventory. From 2020, the tracked \gls{UNF} inventory is reprocessed 
to fuel the deployment of  French \glspl{SFR}. Additionally, a sensitivity study 

These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment
of additional \glspl{LWR} by accepting \gls{UNF} from other EU nations.
