        The French 2012-2015 Commission Nationale d'Evaluation Reports
emphasize preparation for a transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
We used the \Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator to explore the feasibility of enabling a French
transition to an \gls{SFR} fleet by using \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
A \Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the \gls{EU} from 
1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition 
to \glspl{SFR} as existing \glspl{LWR} are decommissioned. These \glspl{SFR} 
are fuelled with \gls{UNF} accumulated by other \gls{EU} nations and 
reprocessed in France.
The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and \gls{SFR} breeding ratios on 
time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. 
These simulation demonstrates that France can avoid deployment of additional 
\glspl{LWR} by accepting \gls{UNF} from other EU nations, that lifetime 
extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not 
particularly impactful.
