        The French 2012-2015 Commission Nationale d'Evaluation Reports
\cite{cne2_reports_2015} emphasize preparation for a transition from \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR}.
We used \Cyclus \cite{huff_fundamental_2016} to explore the feasibility of enabling a French
transition to an \gls{SFR} fleet by using \gls{UNF} from other \gls{EU} nations.
A \Cyclus simulation from 1970 for \gls{EU} nations to track the \gls{UNF} mass
and tails inventory in 2050.In the same simulation, we simulated the French
transition to \glspl{SFR} supported by reprocessing the \gls{UNF} inventory accumulated by the \gls{EU} nations.
These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment
of additional \glspl{LWR} by accepting \gls{UNF} from other EU nations.
